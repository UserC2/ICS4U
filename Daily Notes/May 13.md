OSS: "Open Source Software"

## Characteristics of Open Source
* Source code is publically available
* Public contributions are welcome

## Why Open Source?
### From a Maintainer's Perspective
* Draw on talent from people across the world (much cheaper)
* Altruism: Sharing the code allows others to learn from it
  * e.g. FIRST Robotics teams
* Improve corporate image
* Users can contribute to finding problems:
  * For example, imagine if four freight companies each operated their own railroad. If one broke, only that company would worry about fixing it, and they might not have the resources to fix it as quickly as they would like.
  * Now, imagine if all four companies used the same railroad (assuming it had the same capacity). If the railroad was damaged, each of the companies could work together, sending their best engineers to fix the problem.
  * This allows the problem to be solved quickly (because there's more people to do so), but also because each of the company's engineers could have different experience, so maybe one of company A's engineers has experience repairing bridges, and the rest of the companies do not. Instead of each company hiring an engineer with experience repairing bridges, the companies can pool their resources and save money.
* **Lock-in: Encouraging others to use your project (and having them work on it) encourages them to keep using it (and working on it).**

### From a Contributor's Perspective
* Fix problems that don't work without having to wait for others to do so
  * e.g. OneNote still having no "group" feature for drawings after it was suggested
* Altruism: You provide your time for a community
* Get experience working with actual projects
* **Build a portfolio you can show your employer**

## How to Contribute
Search for projects applicable to your field or interest, then you can:
* Validate/sort through issues
* Contribute to forum discussions
* Design new features
* Improve documentation
* Test & report issues
* Write code!

## Seven Step Contribution Process
1. Choose a project!
  * One you already use is easiest (and helps you)
  * Or open GitHub and look in "Explore"
2. Look through issues; find something you're comfortable with working on
3. Check for contributing rules (e.g. in `Contributing.md`)
4. Fork the project, clone it, and make a branch for your changes
5. Make then commit your changes
6. Open a pull request on the parent project to merge your fork
7. Wait for feedback from others
  * Don't take feedback personally! â€” It's part of the process for contributing
