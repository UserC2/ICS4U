## Computer Basics
Computer: Something that computes!
- Machine that follows a bunch of instructions and performs math.
- Note that most of the stuff you do is not math (e.g. browsing TikTok), so how does a computer perform it?
- CODE: Make it a math problem.

## Abstraction:
- "How to eat an elephant": Break down a complex problem into several smaller ones (and keep breaking those down until you can solve them).
- e.g. Picasso painting: Concepts present, details of implementation are not particularly present
- High level: Lots of details missing; concepts explored instead. (This is typically where the course will operate.)
- Low level: Specifics and implementation details. E.g. physical and chemical properties of computer hardware (or a bit higher level than that, assembly)
- Some things that appear low level aren't... (E.g. assembly)
- For example, taking the bus to school. This can be broken down into:
  - Get ready, walk, get on bus, wait, get off bus
  - Walk: Move legs in specific pattern
  - Move legs: Muscle contractions
  - Can go into how the muscle cells work too!
