# Cybersecurity
**April 15, 2024**

## Does and Don'ts
### Do/Always
* Have unique passwords
* Buy all common misspellings of your domain names to avoid phishing attacks
* Pick a hard password
* Use a password manager (with an appropriate password!)
* Use Two-Factor Authentication
  * Uses two seperate communication channels to verify your identity (e.g. password & text or password & email)
* Use Incognito mode (destroys any data at the end of the session)

### Don't/Never
* Share with anyone else (now they're responsible for your secret)
* Post things you don't want around forever (because it will be!)
* Click on links you are sent without validating the address
* Store your passwords in an insecure location (e.g. sticky note on the kitchen table)
* Share your device with others (huge security risk if they have access to your email/passwords)
* Leave a device unlocked

## Ransomware
* Malicious software that encrypts your data and then requires you to pay in order to decrypt it
* Typically the payment method is untraceable.
