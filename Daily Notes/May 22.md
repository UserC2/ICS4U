# The Economics of Artifical Intelligence
**May 22, 2024**

## An Economist's View
* AI is important because it can be applied very generally, much like semiconductors were.
* AI provides cheap prediction, so non-prediction problems can be converted to prediction problems to take advantage of it.
  * e.g. driving, translation (used to be a set of rules)
* This is similar to the rise of semiconductors, where non-arithmetic problems were converted to arithmetic problems to take advantage of cheap arithmetic provided by semiconductors.

## Compliments and Substitutes
In economics, "compliments" of a resource go up in value when the cost of the resource goes down.
* e.g. Cream and sugar are compliments of coffee, and would increase in value if coffee got cheaper (because coffee would be consumed more).

"Substitutes" of a resource go down in value when the cost of the resource goes down.
* e.g. Tea is a substitute for coffee, and would decrease in value if coffee got cheaper (because people begin to drink coffee instead of tea).

AI has compliments and substitutes too â€” the most obvious one is *human prediction* (a substitute for AI).

As AI improves, the value of human prediction goes down (which is what the media often focuses on), *however* AI has several compliments, which will increase in value (such as *data* and *human judgement*).

#### This effect has happened many times previously, e.g. with accountants:

Accountants' skills could be divided into two categories: data entry & arithmetic, and data analysis.

Once spreadsheet software was becoming more popular, the value of data entry and arithmetic decreased as it was replaced, but data analysis became easier and as a result more valuable.

## Strategy
* AI is typically used as a tool to make a strategy more efficient (much like a word processor makes typing more efficient).
* However, AI can sometimes cause a strategy to fundamentally change (called *disruption*).

### Amazon Example
* AI is currently used to display items to the user they are likely to buy.
* If the accuracy of the prediction model could be improved, you could ship a box of items you think the user might buy to them before they pay, and then collect payment for the items they take.
* By improving the accuracy of AI, shopping changes from a *shop-then-ship* model to a *ship-then-shop* model, significantly increasing profits.
